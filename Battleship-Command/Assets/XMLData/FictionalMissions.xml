Good morning Commander,
Today we have been entrusted to test
out the new prototype they have been
developing for the Battleship Iowa.

The new prototype looks very slick,
but be aware that any issues are
due to the prototype status. Be sure
to note any issues you see, and make
sure to tell the scientist about any
issues.

Make us proud out there commander.

Admiral John Doe.
